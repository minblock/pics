<br><B>Hints and Tips</B>
<P><B>How to use:</B><BR>Take a photo, give it a 5.&nbsp; From this score use 
the following point increments/decrements to alter the score until you have 
completed the list.&nbsp; At this point you should have a fairly accurate 
representation of your score :) </P>
<P><b>Notes:</b>We do not warrent this is in anyway correct, although we 
have paid attention in the past, and we find that this seems to work well
.&nbsp; We also realise there are different options on the 
website, for rating both males and females, and restricting the ages groups 
viewed.&nbsp; Our settings where for females in the age range 18-25, whether 
these rules are fitting in other age groups is for you to decided.&nbsp; We also 
mean no offence to anyone, so don't take us too seriously :)</SMALL></SMALL>
